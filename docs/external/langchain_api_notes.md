Relevant pieces to reuse

1) APIChain pattern (libs/langchain/langchain/chains/api/base.py)
- LangChain provides `APIChain`, which takes an OpenAPI spec (string) as `api_docs`, uses an LLM to produce an `api_url`, performs the request, and summarizes the response.
- Important: the library explicitly warns about "allow_dangerous_requests" and the security risk of allowing arbitrary requests from models.

Typical code flow (conceptual):

- Build `api_request_chain` (LLM prompt that, given question + api_docs, outputs a URL/request)
- Execute the request via a safe `requests_wrapper` (TextRequestsWrapper)
- Pass response into `api_answer_chain` (LLM summarizer) to generate final answer

Security note to copy into your docs:
- Do NOT expose model-driven API calls to untrusted users. Limit domains, require opt-in, and sanitize outputs.

2) Agent primitives
- AgentAction, AgentFinish, AgentExecutor shapes are defined in `agents/agent.py` and test coverage shows streaming and async variants.
- If you plan to add an "agent that calls your APIs", reuse `AgentExecutor` and tool wiring patterns, but include strict domain allow-listing and rate limits.

3) Documentation links
- LangChain's user docs (python.langchain.com) are the canonical reference; use their examples for implementing an API-driven chain or an agent that calls OpenAPI endpoints.

How to reuse quickly
- For a feature that lets LLMs call your service described by OpenAPI, reuse the `APIChain` prompt patterns and the `allow_dangerous_requests` guard. Provide a small wrapper that:
  - validates/limits outgoing URLs
  - uses a requests wrapper with limited timeouts
  - logs and audits all outbound model-driven requests
